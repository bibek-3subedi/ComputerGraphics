Lab 2:
Bresenham’s Line Drawing Algorithm

Bresenham’s line algorithm is an algorithm which determines which order to form a close
approximation to a straight line between two given points. Write a C program for determining pixel
activation list between two given points in order to draw line segment using bresenham’s Line
drawing algorithm?


Aim: To implement Bresenham’s line drawing algorithm for drawing a line segment between two
given endpoints A (x1, y2) and B(x2, y2).


Description:
Basic Concept:
1. Move across the x axis in unit intervals and at each step choose between two
different y coordinates
2.For example, from position (2, 3) we have to choose between (3, 3) and (3, 4). We
would like the point that is closer to the original line
3.So we have to take decision to choose next point. So next pixels are selected based
on the value of decision parameter p. The equations are given in below algorithm.

Algorithm:
BRESENHAM’S LINE DRAWING ALGORITHM
1. Input the two line end-points, storing the left end-point in (x0, y0)
2. Plot the point (x0, y0)
3. Calculate the constants Δx, Δy, 2Δy, and (2Δy - 2Δx) and get the first value for the decision
parameter as:

p0=2△y-△x

4. At each xk along the line, starting at k = 0, perform the following test. If pk < 0, the next point
to plot is (xk+1, yk ) and:

pk+1=pk+2△y
Otherwise, the next point to plot is (xk+1, yk+1) and:
pk+1=pk+2△y-2△x
5. Repeat step 4 (Δx – 1) times

NOTE: The algorithm and derivation above assumes slopes are less than 1. For other slopes
we need to adjust the algorithm slightly
