Creating two dimensional objects

Using certain graphic functions available in C-language for drawing lines, rectangles & circles, Write a CProgram which generates pixel activation list for drawing the following simple two dimensional objects
(Circle, Ellipse…..).
i) House ii) Car iii) Fish iv) man?
Aim: To write a C-program for creating simple two dimensional shape of house, car, fish, man using lines,
circles etc.

Description:
The following graphics functions are available for creating two dimensional shapes in C.
line circle
ellipse
rectangle
drawpoly

line: line function is used to draw a line from a point(x1,y1) to point(x2,y2) i.e. (x1,y1) and (x2,y2)
are end points of the line.
Declaration: - line(x1, y1, x2, y2); ---line (100,200,300,400);

Circle: Circle function is used to draw a circle with center (x, y) and third parameter specifies the
radius of the circle.
Declaration: circle(x, y, r)—circle (100, 200, 25) ;( 25 is radius of circle, (100,100) is center of
circle).

Ellipse: Ellipse is used to draw an ellipse (x, y) are coordinates of center of the ellipse, startangle is
the starting angle, endangle is the ending angle, and fifth and sixth parameters specifies the X and
Y radius of the ellipse. To draw a complete ellipse strangles and end angle should be 0 and 360
respectively.

Usage: ellipse(x, y, startangle, endangle, xradius, yradius);--ellipse(100,200,0,360,25,45);((100,200)
is center of ellipse, 0 is start angle, 360 is end angle, 25 is x-axis radius, 45 is radius circle).
Rectangle: rectangle function is used to draw a rectangle. Coordinates of left top and right bottom
corner are required to draw the rectangle. left specifies the X-coordinate of top left corner, top
specifies the Y-coordinate of top left corner, right specifies the X-coordinate of right bottom
corner, bottom specifies the Y-coordinate of right bottom corner.

Syntax: rectangle(left,top,right,bottom);--rectangle(100,200,300,400);

Drawpoly: Drawpoly function is used to draw polygons i.e. triangle, rectangle, pentagon, hexagon
etc.

Syntax: drawpoly( num,points );--num indicates number of vertices of polygon. Num = num+1.

Example: we will draw a triangle using drawpoly, consider for example the array :-
int points[] = { 320, 150, 420, 300, 250, 300, 320, 150};
points array contains coordinates of triangle which are (320, 150), (420, 300) and (250, 300). 
Note that last point(320, 150) in array is same as first.

Number of vertices are denoted by num. for any polygon, number of vertices are (num+1). For
triangle, number of vertices are 4.
